Project Title: Deaths by drug overdose and possible contributing factors

Team Members: Morgan Bee, Rowan Clark, Amy Dos Santos, Brian Hester, Kiley Karecki

Description/Outline: Relationship between High school graduation rates, Unemployment Rates, and Median Household Income on the Yearly rate of death by drug overdose by State for the years (2021, 2022 and 2023)

We are interested in identifying possible contributing factors to death rates by drug overdose to better understand this phenomenon and hopefully better guide efforts to reduce this rate.

Variables (averages over 2021-2023):
    * Deaths by drug overdose = Average death rate by drug overdose by total population
    * Education rate = Average Highschool graduation rates adult 18 and over (includes equivalent) by total population
    * Unemployment = Average unemployment rate by total employable population
    * Socioeconomic status = Average household median income per year


Research Questions to Answer:
    Q1.  How does education rates (high school graduation) affect overdose rates by county across different regional areas in the United States?
    Q2. Is there a link between socioeconomic status (household median income) and rate of overdoses? Does a combination of low socioeconomic status and low education rate compound the risk of drug overdose, and vice versa? 
    Q3. Does unemployment rate affect rates of drug overdose by state?
